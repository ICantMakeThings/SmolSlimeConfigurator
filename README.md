# Odd notes:

+ If you want to feel safe running this program, read the Python code and run it from the .py.
+ If a tracker has old pair data it wont connect to your reciever, plug your tracker in and "Clear Con. data".
+ If the trackers and recievers arent on the same daily build, they will not want to connect.
+ There is a [.html](https://github.com/jitingcn/SmolSlimeWebConfigurator) version of this app, and hosted on a [website](https://gh.jtcat.com/SmolSlimeConfigurator.html), made by [jitingcn](https://github.com/jitingcn).
+ You cant flash Nordic-eByte/Holyiot Receivers
