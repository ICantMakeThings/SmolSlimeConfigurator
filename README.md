Compiled for Linux+Windows and raw .py file avalable, .exe has not been tested. but its the same code, must work, righttttttt?
If not, open a issue.

~~As of rn, v2, windows dont work with flashing.~~
V2(3) works, but the hours, i hate windows.
I really hope this is of use to someone, 

You have 3 options:
- A installer
- B standaline application but not a single file.
- C .Py File

If anyone is interested, I couldnt build with pyinstaller because of a stupid error, So i used cx_Freeze, and Inno Setup Compiler
If anyone knows whats up i'd be greatfull, and so would the other 2 ppl using this program.
